                Just some random writing to pad out the white space on this site. To be honest, I 
                used to corchet so I chose it as a topic but now I just have a bunch of yarn in my room 
                that I want to get rid of but making things is tiring and honestly, I don't like the 
                texture of yarn so it's just a concerning pile of gifted yarn that I hate touching and 
                working with as crocheting somehow irritates my lungs and makes me cough and sneeze. On 
                second thought, perhaps I'm allergic to certain yarn fibers.

                Does yarn rot? I have no idea. The internet seems to have opinions about that but overall 
                people say no. But then I swear some yarn is more flaky or smelly as they age. Or maybe it was 
                because I stored it weird? Does yarn have to breath? How do you store yarn? I ask but I also 
                don't care enough to actually research and properly store my pile of yarn.
